- secret key is `sha256` hash generated by program and will be printed by program and write to `secret_key.txt` file.


- you must enter a salt for more security in generating secret key


- input image must be `png` image.


- hidden info will be read from `data.txt` file in the same directory as program

---
##Running

* `python3 -m venv venv`
* `pip install - requirements.txt`

### hiding data in image

`python main.py --hide -c <path_to_cover_image>`

### extracting data from image

`python main.py --extract -s <path_to_stego_image>`
